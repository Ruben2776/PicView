### Convert/Optimize all your pictures
All files from the `Source folder` will be selected for processing and will be sent to `Output folder`. The default name for the output folder will be **Processed Pictures**.

If the *Output folder* is the same as the *Source folder*, or left blank, the files will be overwrittten.

The `Convert to` dropdown option allows you to convert all the files to a popular format.

The `Compression` dropdown option allows you to compress the files, either without losing quality or sacrifing some quality for greater reduced file size.

The `Quality` dropdown option allows you to change quality of supported file types. The higher the Quality setting, the more detail is preserved in the image, but the larger the file size.

The `Resize` dropdown option allows you to resize the picture by **height**, **width** and **percentage** while keeping the aspect ratio of the image.
